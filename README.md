# Hack_AMLIntro
AML Hack for Deploying a Model for Real-time Inferencing &amp; Generating a Pipeline for Batch Inferencing

## Working with Compute Instances:

Compute Instances
Working with data, pip installs from terminal
Working with data - registering a dataset

## Running an experiment

Training locally - setting up a preprocessing pipeline, test/training, logging metrics
Registering a model

## Working with Compute Cluster

Running an experiment with a compute cluster - creating environments
Registering a model

## Hyper Parameter Tuning

Leverage Hyper Parameter tuning for model creation

## Creating a Rest End point

Creating ACI rest end point
Leverage ACI rest endpoint

## Creating a batch inferencing pipeline

Create pipeline to ingest data, batch inference, register inference dataset

## AutoML

Designer to create model
Notebook AutoML
